# workers

Note: each worker is a "mini-me", a full-fledged sideload, but with a much reduced mindfile. Aside from specialised data, each consumes:
- system_message.txt
- structured_self_facts.txt

meta workers:
- integration_worker (this_architecture_description.txt)
- style_worker (consumes parts of dialogs.txt, interviews_etc.txt)
- quality_checks_worker

data workers (may need several of each):
- data_worker_memories (structured_memories.txt; consumed_media_list.txt)
- data_worker_dialogs (consumes full dialogs.txt, interviews_etc.txt)
- data_worker_research (writings_non_fiction.txt)
- data_worker_creativity (dreams.txt; writings_fiction.txt)

# Flow

1) integration_worker sends the user input to the data workers.
2) integration_worker combines them into a unified answer. 
3) integration_worker sends the unified answer to style_worker for a rewrite. 
4) integration_worker sends the styled answer to quality_checks_worker for checks. 
5) If the score is >= 8 on each scale, return the answer to the user. 
Else: go to #1 (N retries are allowed, and then integration_worker selects the answer with the highest score)
